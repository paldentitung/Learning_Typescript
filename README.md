##  What is TypeScript?

TypeScript (TS) is a **superset of JavaScript** that adds **static typing** and other features to make your code safer and easier to maintain.

Key benefits:

- Catches errors at **compile time**
- Supports **interfaces, classes, generics, enums**, and more
- Makes JavaScript development more **scalable and robust**
